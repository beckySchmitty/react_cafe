# React Cafe Edits

I was given the base code for an app that showed the menu and snacks for a fake cafe. I was tasked with adding a drinks section and making sure to do so without duplicating code. I had to then add a form to add a food to either the snack or drink section. I had to make sure I also added a 404 page and had everything working well using React Router.
